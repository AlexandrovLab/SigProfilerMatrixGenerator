This output folder returns files containing all the insertions and deletions found within the samples. If no files are returned, this means no insertions or deletions were found.

### Optional ID89 and ID476 Counts

The `feature/id89-id476` development branch can additionally generate
`<project>.ID89.all` and `<project>.ID476.all` with
`indel_contexts=("89", "476")` in Python or `--indel_contexts 89 476` on the
CLI. Existing ID83 outputs are unchanged. The new raw-count matrices have 89
and 476 rows respectively, with one column per sample, and a separate audit
report records per-event classifications and exclusions. Exome and BED runs
use `.exome` and `.region` suffixes.

See the [ID89/ID476 guide](ID89-ID476.md) for branch installation, examples,
filtering and complex-event conventions. New-context plotting and downstream
signature catalogue support are not included.

### ID-28 ###
The *test.ID28.all* file identifies all 1 bp (C and T only) insertions and deletions from homopolymer length 1 to 6+, the >1bp deletions and insertions as repeats, and all other indels in the microhomology category and categorizes each by length. 

The generated plot above gives a visual for how each indel is categorized and returned. 

| Mutation Type | Sample 1 (PD10001a) | Sample 2 (PD10011a) | ..... |
| ------- |  ------- |  ------- |  ------- |
| 6 rows for 1:Del:C:0 to 1:Del:C:5 | frequency of each deletion of C in sample 1 | frequency of each deletion of C in sample 2 | .... |
| 6 rows for 1:Del:T:0 to 1:Del:T:5 | frequency of each deletion of T in sample 1 | frequency of each deletion of T in sample 2 | .... |
| 6 rows for 1:Ins:C:0 to 1:Ins:C:5 | frequency of each insertion of C in sample 1 | frequency of each insertion of C in sample 2 | .... |
| 6 rows for 1:Ins:C:0 to 1:Ins:C:5 |frequency of each insertion of T in sample 1 | frequency of each insertion of T in sample 2 | .... |
| long_Del (repeat units) | frequency of each long deletion in sample 1 | frequency of each long deletion in sample 2 | .... |
| long_Ins (repeat units) | frequency of each long insertion in sample 1 | frequency of each long insertion in sample 2 | .... |
| MH (microhomology) | 0 | 0 | | |
| complex | 0 | 0 | | |

The above image is a screenshot of the generated file. Here, on line **5**, 1:Del:C:3 corresponds to a deletion of C in a sequence N[C]CCCN where N is represents any nucleotide A, T, or G to give NCCCN. 

### ID-83 ###
The *test.ID83.all* file further categorizes each unique repeat and microhomology indel found. 

| *test.ID28.all* | *test.ID83.all* |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| long_Del | 2:Del:R:0 - 2:Del:R:5<br> 3:Del:R:0 - 3:Del:R:5<br> 4:Del:R:0 - 4:Del:R:5 <br> 5:Del:R:0 - 5:Del:R:5|
| long_Ins | 2:Ins:R:0 - 2:Ins:R:5<br> 3:Ins:R:0 - 3:Ins:R:5<br> 4:Ins:R:0 - 4:Ins:R:5 <br> 5:Ins:R:0 - 5:Ins:R:5|
| MH | 2:Del:M:1 - 5:Del:M:5 <br> 2:Ins:M:1 - 5:Ins:M:5 |

Here, on line **3**, 1:Del:C:1 corresponds to a deletion of C in a sequence N[C]CN where N is represents any nucleotide A, C, or G to give NCN.

### ID-415 ###
The *test.ID415.all* file categorizes each identified indel from *test.ID83.all* into the 5 transcriptional strand bias categories {T, U, N, B, Q}.

83 x 5 = 415 combinations
    
For example, a category in *test.ID83.all* would be further categorized into the following in *test.ID415.all*.

| *test.ID83.all* | *test.ID415.all* |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 4:Del:R:4 | T:4:Del:R:4 <br> U:4:Del:R:4 <br> N:4:Del:R:4 <br> B:4:Del:R:4 <br> Q:4:Del:R:4|

The above image is a screenshot of the generated file. Here, on line **7**, T:1:Del:C:5 corresponds to a deletion of C in a sequence N[C]CCCCCN where N is represents any nucleotide A, C, or G to give NCCCCCN. 
on the transcribed strand.

### ID-8268 ###
The test.ID8268.all file extends the categorization from the ID-83 matrix by providing complete information about the indel sequence for indels at repetitive regions with length less than 6bp. 

| *test.ID8268.all* |  |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 2:Del:TA:5 | Deletion of length 2 with sequence TC or GA (reverse complement)|
| 5:Ins:CCATC:2 | Insertion of length 5 with sequence CCATC or GATGG (reverse complement)|
