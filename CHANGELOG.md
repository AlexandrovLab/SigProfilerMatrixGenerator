# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Add optional Koh ID89 and ID476 count matrices through `indel_contexts` and
  `--indel_contexts`, retaining the existing ID83 classifier and outputs.
  Include canonical channel order, per-event audit reports, WGS/WES/BED and
  chromosome output, and an independent R-oracle fixture covering all channels.
- Make regression-mode discovery safe for missing fixtures, while preserving
  explicit errors when running a genome without complete regression inputs.
- Share CHM13 interval coordinate conversion between both opportunity builders.
- Add 48 CHM13 whole-genome/exome opportunity resources: integer counts and
  male/female chromosome distributions for eight contexts, with a reproducible
  builder, independent source-level validation, and explicit downstream limits.
- Correct the CHM13 exome opportunity coordinate conversion without changing
  historical coordinate handling for other references.
- Register `mm39_Legacy` with the original mm39 archive checksums and
  opportunity tables for reproducibility.
- Added support for the T2T-CHM13v2.0 human reference genome (CHM13-T2T), nuclear chromosomes only (1–22, X, Y). Network installation becomes available when the corrected archive described under **Reference Data** is published to the AlexandrovLab FTP.
- Added `scripts/build_refseq_references.py`, the developer tool that derives both the CHM13-T2T exome interval list and its per-chromosome transcript files from a pinned NCBI RefSeq annotation release, so the shipped files can be regenerated and audited rather than only described. Replaces `scripts/build_exome_interval_list.py`, whose behaviour is now the `exome-list` subcommand.
- Added an exome interval list for CHM13-T2T, so `exome=True` is supported alongside WGS. It is annotation-derived (union of all CDS features in NCBI RefSeq annotation release `GCF_009914755.1-RS_2025_08`, merged; 213,010 intervals over 36.4 Mb) rather than a capture-kit definition, so CHM13-T2T exome matrices are not directly comparable to GRCh38 exome matrices. See `docs/Currently-Supported-Genomes.md` for the full derivation.
- Register `GRCh38_Legacy` with the chromosome checksums and context tables from
  the previously distributed GRCh38 reference so historical results remain
  reproducible.
- Register `mm10_Legacy` with the chromosome checksums and context tables from
  the previously distributed mm10 reference so historical results remain
  reproducible.
- Register `GRCh37_Legacy` against a copy of the untouched historical archive
  named `GRCh37_Legacy.tar.gz` and preserve its supporting tables for
  reproducible older analyses.
- Record the exact Ensembl GRCh37 FASTA and annotation sources, checksums, and
  retained historical transcript scope used to rebuild the corrected reference.
- Register `mm9_Legacy` with the untouched historical mm9 archive and context
  tables so earlier analyses remain reproducible.
- Register `rn6_Legacy`, `rn7_Legacy`, `dog_Legacy`, and `c_elegans_Legacy`
  against the historical chromosome archives for reproducible older analyses.

### Changed
- Rebuild the default `mm39` transcription-strand chromosome data and its
  whole-genome and exome opportunity tables from validated GRCm39 sources.
  Existing mm39 installations must be reinstalled after upgrading. Raw
  sequence-only mutation counts retain the same DNA, but opportunity-based
  normalization can change because historical context tables had drifted.
- Regenerated the CHM13-T2T transcript files, and with them the whole TSB reference payload, against NCBI RefSeq annotation release `GCF_009914755.1-RS_2025_08`. The previous files came from an earlier release that was never recorded, so neither they nor the TSB files derived from them could be reproduced from any pinned source. All 24 per-chromosome checksums in `CHECKSUMS` change as a result. Note that RS_2025_08 annotates 4,993 transcripts on chrY against 882 before, almost all Gnomon-predicted lncRNA models in the Yq12 satellite region newly resolved by T2T, so transcriptional strand assignments on chrY shift substantially.
- `exome=True` now fails immediately with an actionable message naming the missing interval list and the genomes that do support exome downsampling, instead of raising a bare `FileNotFoundError` after every chromosome has already been parsed.
- Exome interval list paths are resolved through `ReferenceDir.get_exome_dir()` / `get_exome_interval_list()` rather than being assembled by hand in several places.
- Promote the corrected transcription-strand reference to the default `GRCh38`
  identity, including validated strand-aware whole-genome and exome context-count
  and distribution tables. Existing installations of the former `GRCh38`
  reference must be reinstalled after upgrading.
- Promote the corrected transcription-strand reference to the default `mm10`
  identity, including validated strand-aware whole-genome and exome context-count
  and distribution tables, and add the whole-genome male `context_distribution_6`
  table that was missing from the historical package. Existing installations of
  the former `mm10` reference must be reinstalled after upgrading.
- Promote corrected GRCh37 transcription-strand labels and strand-dependent
  opportunity tables to the default `GRCh37` identity.
- Resolve logical reference names to their physical archive filenames and
  stage archive extraction so a historical internal directory can be safely
  installed under a distinct Legacy identity.
- Promote the corrected transcription-strand reference to the default `mm9`
  identity. Existing mm9 installations must be reinstalled after upgrading.
- Promote corrected `rn6`, `rn7`, `dog`, and `c_elegans` chromosome labels to
  their default identities; retain their existing DNA sequences.

### Fixed
- Preserve SV32 clustering assignments with pandas Copy-on-Write, including
  hotspot metadata and merged regions; add clustered/nonclustered regressions.
- Generate matrices from a fresh input snapshot on every run so reusing an
  output directory does not silently reuse a previous cohort or removed files.
- Allow rn7 and rn7_Legacy whole-exome and BED matrix generation through the
  chromosome-order lookups used by those workflows.
- Rebuild SBS context-distribution tables from the shared five-base opportunity
  set, preserve valid binary chromosome bytes, include the final valid window,
  and reverse T/U labels when purine contexts are canonicalized.
- Preserve full reference IDs during input conversion and in execution logs;
  explicitly map existing Havana editions to their shared assembly resources.
- Distinguish missing, incomplete, unregistered, and checksum-mismatched
  references in matrix-generation errors without modifying installed files.
- Supply required conversion arguments for `.genome` text input.
- Corrected TSB reference generation at inclusive transcript ends and across
  nested or overlapping transcripts on either strand.
- Read SBS strand labels at the mutation's own position and reject positions
  without the required left flanking sequence instead of wrapping around.
- Compare WGS and exome regression matrices against the correct expected files,
  and fail when required comparisons are missing. The mode-forwarding correction
  was also contributed by Luuk Harbers in PR #250.
- Read combined and headerless transcript annotations without dropping the first
  record. Correctly combine non-adjacent records for the same gene in the internal
  gene-range reader; the public gene-strand analysis option remains unsupported.
- Use the registered reference chromosome list for VCF, text, and MAF conversion
  instead of inferring chromosomes from transcript filenames.
- Preserve the first BED data row after a header, and fix region comparisons
  when the lower bound after applying the cushion is zero.
- Classify FACETS total-copy-number-one segments in existing LOH channels,
  retaining the CNV48 schema (from `fix/facets-cnv48-tcn1-loh`).
- Correct mm9 transcript ends and overlapping-transcript states across all
  chromosomes while retaining the historical transcript scope.

### Reference Data
- Publish corrected `mm39.tar.gz` and preserve the former archive byte-for-byte
  as `mm39_Legacy.tar.gz` before releasing this change.
- Corrected `GRCh38` continues to resolve to its already-published
  `GRCh38.tar.gz`; the separately registered `GRCh38_Legacy` archive remains
  available for old analyses.
- Corrected `mm10` resolves to `mm10.tar.gz`; `mm10_Legacy` resolves to a copy
  of the untouched historical archive named `mm10_Legacy.tar.gz`. Older
  MatrixGenerator releases cannot verify the corrected archive under the
  original name and should upgrade before reinstalling.
- Corrected `GRCh37` resolves to `GRCh37.tar.gz`.
  `GRCh37_Legacy` resolves to `GRCh37_Legacy.tar.gz` with the historical bytes.
  Older MatrixGenerator releases cannot verify the corrected archive under
  the original name and should upgrade before reinstalling.
- Corrected `mm9` resolves to `mm9.tar.gz`; `mm9_Legacy` resolves to a copy
  of the untouched historical archive named `mm9_Legacy.tar.gz`. Older
  MatrixGenerator releases cannot verify the corrected archive under the
  original name and should upgrade before reinstalling.
- `CHM13-T2T.tar.gz` must be published before CHM13-T2T network installation
  can succeed. The original August archive linked in issue #251 predates the
  transcription-strand fixes; the latest PR updates the chromosome checksums.
  Our independently rebuilt replacement archive has SHA-256
  `e8d0309879486beefb83d730c00b8cf8733aa7cd1716f694855817e69943f6a3`;
  source hashes and the reproducible build command are documented in
  `docs/Currently-Supported-Genomes.md`.

## [1.3.6] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- Implemented a CI/CD pipeline with Travis CI to automate the building and publishing of Docker images to GHCR.

## [1.3.5] - 2025-08-05

### Changed
- Updated README to clarify usage and examples.
- Added custom output directory option.

## [1.3.4] - 2025-06-06

### Fixed
- Update file counts for rn7 and mm39 genomes after issue resolving issue with save_context_distribution script where final chromosome was not being processed correctly and counts were being carried over from the previous chromosome.

### Added
- Added pyproject.toml file to the repository to support Python packaging and distribution.

## [1.3.3] - 2025-04-16

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where ID plots were not generated due to the use of an unrecognized plot type (`96ID`). The correct plot type `IDSB` is now used.

### Deprecated
- Removed support for **ICGC input format**. The [ICGC Data Portal officially closed](https://www.icgc-argo.org/) in June 2024, and associated example files are no longer accessible. Since the format is no longer actively maintained or distributed, and unresolved issues remained (see [#158](https://github.com/SigProfilerSuite/SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/issues/158), [#159](https://github.com/SigProfilerSuite/SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/issues/159)), support has been deprecated to reduce maintenance burden and avoid user confusion.

## [1.3.2] - 2025-03-13

### Fixed
- The save_context_distribution script had an error on the edges of chromosomes where the window would extend beyond the chromosome length. This was fixed by limiting the window to the chromosome length.
- The save_context_distribution script had an error when running multiple jobs in paralell because the exome file was being sorted differently for male and female genomes and concurrent jobs would overwrite each other. This was fixed by creating unique temporary files for each run.

### Added
- Context distribution files for mm39 and rn7 genomes.
- Exome file for rn7 genome.


## [1.3.1] - 2025-03-13

### Fixed
- SV Matrix generation compatibility: Updated remnant Pandas and NumPy < 2.0.0 syntax to ensure compatibility with newer versions.
- Indexing error in reference genome handling: Edge cases where BED file indices extended beyond the reference genome range caused crashes. Index accesses are now restricted to valid ranges, and cases where the genomic context extends beyond valid positions are skipped.
- Uninitialized variable: The dinuc_mat variable was accessed before being initialized, causing a runtime error. It is now explicitly initialized to None before use.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-02-11

### Changed
- Updated dependencies: Now requires **Pandas >= 2.0.0**, **NumPy >= 2.0.0**, and **Python >= 3.9**.
- Dropped support for **Python 3.8**

## [1.2.31] - 2024-11-6

### Fixed
- Resolved a bug where DBS and ID matrices were not being returned due to an indentation issue when the parameter 'chrom_based' was set as True.

### Notice
- Python 3.8 support will be phased out in future updates as we align with Python's ongoing release cycle. Users on Python 3.8 are encouraged to consider upgrading to Python 3.9 or newer.

## [1.2.30] - 2024-10-10

### Fixed
- Resolved a bug that caused the code to crash when running with `exome=True` during INDEL processing. The issue was due to incorrect indentation.

## [1.2.29] - 2024-09-24

### Added
- Added sort function to handle non-sorted input and BED files. This posed as an issue for when the BED file was not sorted by chromosome and start position in cases when certain reference genomes were used because of roman numerals and decimal (ie ChrX vs chr10).

### Changed
- Transcript files were modified to adopt the new sorting standard.


## [1.2.28] - 2024-08-06

### Added
- Added support for processing SV input for VCF versions 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. The tool now supports both the previous input format (requiring the first six columns and either the "svclass" column or the "strand1" & "strand2" columns) and VCF files.

### Changed
- Updated the README command line examples to use CLI instead of calling the script directly.

## [1.2.27] - 2024-07-18

### Added
- Added environmental variable `SIGPROFILERMATRIXGENERATOR_VOLUME` to enhance configurability.
- Updated CLI to handle boolean arguments more effectively.

### Changed
- Fixed `binomtest` to use the parameter `k` instead of `x` for improved accuracy and clarity.
- Updated Dockerfile to require SigProfilerMatrixGenerator version 1.2.27 (previously 1.2.25).
- Updated `numpy` dependency to require `numpy>=1.18.5,<2.0.0` to prevent compatibility issues with `numpy` 2.0.0.
- Removed incorrect print statement for the SV plot file path.
