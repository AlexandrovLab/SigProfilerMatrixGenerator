Converting manta.vcf to bedpe format
Performed conversion of VCF to BEDPE and outputted bedpe file to ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/example_input/VCF/manta.SPMG.bedpe
Note that events that could not be classified were outputted to ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/example_output/manta.unclassified.bedpe
Converting lumpy.vcf to bedpe format
Performed conversion of VCF to BEDPE and outputted bedpe file to ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/example_input/VCF/lumpy.SPMG.bedpe
Note that events that could not be classified were outputted to ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/example_output/lumpy.unclassified.bedpe
Converting COLO829v003T.purple.sv.vcf to bedpe format
Performed conversion of VCF to BEDPE and outputted bedpe file to ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/example_input/VCF/COLO829v003T.SPMG.bedpe
Note that events that could not be classified were outputted to ./SigProfilerMatrixGenerator/references/SV/example_output/COLO829v003T.unclassified.bedpe
Converting delly.vcf to bedpe format
